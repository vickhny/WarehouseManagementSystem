# The Assignment: Warehouse Management System

The assignment is to implement a warehouse software. This software should hold articles, and the articles should contain an identification number, a name and available stock. It should be possible to load articles into the software from a file, see the attached inventoryDTO.json.

The warehouse software should also have products, products are made of different articles. Products should have a name, price and a list of articles of which they are made from with a quantity. The products should also be loaded from a file, see the attached products.json. 
 
The warehouse should have at least the following functionality;

* Get all products and quantity of each that is an available with the current inventoryDTO
* Remove(Sell) a product and update the inventoryDTO accordingly
* Search for product
* Uploading an already existing article should increase the article stock

Given two sample input files are:

1. `inventory.json`, which holds the articles should contain an identification number, a name and available stock.`src/main/resources/inventory.json`
2. `products.json`, which contains name, price and a list of articles of which they are made from with a quantity. `src/main/resources/products.json`
